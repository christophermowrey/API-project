The goal of the project was to use IP API that can pull the user's current IP address and allow the user to access different country options through a dropdown menu. This information will then allow the user to be able to convert a certain amount of money to the currency that the country of their choosing uses on the website.

DISCLAIMER: It will not actually convert the user's money, but simply determine how much the user's money would be worth in a specific country.

## Usage

* Click "Get my Country" button, which will open the option to allow or deny the application's use of the user's IP address
* If "Yes" is clicked, retrieve the location of user's IP address and display their city and country above the "Get my Country" button
* If "No" or the X button is clicked, return to the home screen.
* Then, select the country you are visiting using the dropdown on the right side of the screen
* Then, enter the amount you want to convert in the text box at the center of the screen
* Then amount should convert, once click "Show Me the Money!" button
